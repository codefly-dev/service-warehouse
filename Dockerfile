# The warehouse gateway image. A client speaks only the codefly/warehouse/v0
# gRPC contract; every backend is compiled in and selected at runtime by
# SWH_BACKEND. The image ships no warehouse credentials: those arrive as
# environment at deploy time.
#
# cgo is on, and the runtime image carries glibc and libstdc++ (distroless/cc).
# The embedded DuckDB engine is a cgo driver (internal/backend/duckdb), so a
# CGO_ENABLED=0 build onto distroless/static would keep building until the
# driver lands and then stop. Both stages name Debian 13 explicitly: the binary
# links against the build stage's glibc and needs one at least as new in the
# image it runs in, which "golang:1.27" moving to the next Debian would break.
